Puns
=====

Here are a few wordplays that could one day make an R-some R-ticle ;-)
I know, I should be R-rested for making such puns. After all, I'm not a famous R-tist or anything. But then I might have to spend time in prison alongside R-sonists. I fear a movie about that would have to be rated "R"...

Anyway, drop me a line or a github issue if you have additional ideas. --> berry-b@gmx.de

To err is human. To R is better.  
My second most favorite country? R-gentina  
My favorite country? R-menia (pronounce mania for a double pun)  
David McArthur at UseR!2014: I think, therefore I am. We think, therefore we R.  
I'm statistically R-m'd (armed)  
Adrian Baddeley to his dog at the computer: "What are you doing?" The dog: "Rrrrrr" (UseR!2015)  
Pirates program in Rrrr



Here are a few lines of famous songs that I want to turn into an R-song:

Don't cry for me Rgentina (Madonna)  
I just died in your Rms tonight (Cutting Crew)  
PokRface (Lady Gaga)  
We didn't start the FiR (Billy Joel)  
I was born under a wandering stR (Lee Marvin)  
Here we R now (Nirvana)  
Turn R-ound (Bonnie Tyler)
